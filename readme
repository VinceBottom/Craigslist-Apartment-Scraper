This project scrapes Craigslist apartment posts for San Francisco based on built-in Craigslist parameters to find ADUs (accessory dwelling units) or in-law suites posted today.

It takes these results and compiles them into a CSV file. It is meant to run once per day to create a list of apartment search leads.

To search in your city instead of San Francisco, simply replace the requests link with a Craigslist link with your desired parameters.

Happy apartment hunting!
